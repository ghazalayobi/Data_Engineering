# Data Engineering Project Report:  Maven Pizza Challenge Dataset #


This report includes a comprehensive description of my project. I used the Maven Pizza Challenge Dataset from Kaggle to complete this task. The dataset contains the annual sales data of a fictitious pizza place officially collected for the Maven Pizza Challenge. It includes the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on pizza size, type, quantity, price, and ingredients.
